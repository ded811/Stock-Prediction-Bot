The app has all of my focus
When predicting short term stocks, the less data the better
When predicting long term stocks, the more data the better
Theirs a little bit of leaway here so do what every the fuck you feel is best

Also I ain't never had to make python and html fuck and create some unholy fuck child so idk what the fuck im doin
